# Exam Layout Notes

## Overview
This document tracks how the Premium Exam Room layout aligns with the official computer‑delivered IELTS interface.

## Implemented Conventions
- **Fixed header** – header remains pinned to the top of the viewport.
- **Central timer** – countdown timer is centered in the header for clear visibility.
- **Question palette on the right** – navigation grid sits to the right of the question content, mirroring IELTS navigation.
- **Answer sheet slot** – dedicated area beneath the question content for response inputs.

## Deviations & Enhancements
- **Theme switcher** – retained in the header for development convenience; not present in the official IELTS interface.
- **Flexible question count** – palette grid accepts any total number of questions; IELTS typically uses 40.

These points should be revisited before launch to ensure the experience matches or intentionally improves on IELTS conventions.
