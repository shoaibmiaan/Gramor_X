# Personas (Concise)

## P1: Student on Mobile (Primary)
- Needs: quick mock start, resume later, low data usage
- Pain: heavy pages, hidden CTAs, login friction
- Success: one module/day + visible band trend

## P2: Repeater Candidate (Focused)
- Needs: target weak skills, tips to raise band
- Pain: noisy UI, too many choices
- Success: fast path to weak areas + clear improvement

## P3: Coach/Teacher (Secondary)
- Needs: assign tasks, track students
- Pain: unclear dashboards
- Success: simple sharing + visible progress
