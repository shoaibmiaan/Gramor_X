+### Quick PR Checklist
+
+Apply this checklist to every related PR:
+
+- Type-safe (Zod in/out), no `any`
+- Hooks only at top level
+- Use `Link/NavLink` for internal navigation
+- Use design-system tokens only; no hard-coded hex values; rely on `next/image` for images
+- Axe clean, keyboard flows verified, RTL/i18n support
+- Save-Data, low-data, and offline behaviors tested
+- Perf budgets met on Slow 4G / mid-tier Android
+- Observability in place: probes, metrics, alerts
+- Docs/runbooks updated for regional operations
