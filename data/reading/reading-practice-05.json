      "text": "Cities are piloting community kitchens that offer nutrition classes alongside low-cost meals. Participants cook together, learn budgeting skills, and receive guidance from dietitians. Early evaluations in Chicago report declines in household food waste and improved diabetes management among attendees. Local councils are considering subscription models to fund ingredients without relying solely on donations.",

      "text": "Advances in microfluidics have produced handheld devices that analyse blood samples within minutes. Rural clinics in Kenya and Nepal now deploy the tools to screen for malaria and anaemia without full laboratories. Training community health workers to use the devices is vital; the most successful programmes pair on-site coaching with remote troubleshooting hotlines. Regulators still require lab confirmation for critical cases, but the devices speed up triage and treatment.",

      "text": "Universities increasingly share labs via online booking systems that allow startups to rent equipment during off-peak hours. Shared platforms lower the cost of experimentation and encourage partnerships between academia and industry. Some institutions provide mentorship credits, giving entrepreneurs access to faculty advice alongside lab time. However, administrators must enforce safety protocols and protect intellectual property when multiple teams share facilities.",
