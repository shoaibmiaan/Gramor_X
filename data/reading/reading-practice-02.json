      "title": "Citizen Science from Space",
      "text": "High-resolution satellite imagery is no longer the preserve of governments. Platforms now invite volunteers to tag images for signs of deforestation, illegal fishing, and glacier retreat. Projects like CoastWatch convert public annotations into alerts for local authorities. While critics worry about data accuracy, organisers say they cross-check submissions and use machine learning to flag anomalies before they are acted upon.",

      "title": "Reviving Traditional Grains",
      "text": "Quinoa and millet once dominated high-altitude farming but were displaced by imported wheat. Climate shocks and soil degradation are prompting Andean farmers to revive the grains with government support. Researchers note that diverse crop rotations improve resilience and nutrition, though market access remains a hurdle. Cooperatives are experimenting with online direct-to-consumer sales to secure higher prices.",

      "title": "Designing Inclusive Museums",
      "text": "Museums worldwide are working to welcome neurodiverse visitors. Quiet hours with reduced lighting, multi-sensory guides, and preview videos help people prepare for exhibitions. Some institutions co-design experiences with autistic advocates to ensure signage, seating, and ticketing feel intuitive. Funding such adaptations can be challenging, but many museums now track visitor feedback to demonstrate the social impact of inclusive design.",
