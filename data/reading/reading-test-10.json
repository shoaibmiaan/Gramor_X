      "text": "The Meridian Railworks Museum occupies a decommissioned roundhouse that once serviced steam locomotives. When the site closed in 1978, many artefacts were sold off, leaving only a few engine shells behind. A preservation trust reacquired three locomotives from scrapyards and restored the turntable so visitors can watch engines rotate during demonstrations. Conservation staff catalogued thousands of brass fittings, polishing some for display while storing others in climate-controlled drawers.\n\nTo connect the museum to the modern rail network, volunteers rebuilt a kilometre of track linking the roundhouse to the active main line. Weekend heritage services now run short excursions operated by retired drivers who share stories about railway life. A digital studio records oral histories from former employees, and interactive exhibits let visitors simulate scheduling trains across the 1930s network. Ticket revenue funds apprenticeships in metalworking and boiler maintenance. The museum partners with the national railway company to test hydrogen retrofit kits on one of the preserved engines.",

      "title": "Micro-Credentials in Context",
      "text": "Education analyst Priyanka Das assesses the rise of micro-credentials—short, focused qualifications offered online. She observes that employers increasingly request proof of specific skills rather than broad degrees. Das applauds universities that co-design micro-credentials with industry partners while ensuring credits can stack toward full qualifications. She warns, however, that poorly regulated providers may sell badges with little academic oversight.\n\nDas argues that micro-credentials should complement, not replace, foundational learning. She supports public funding to help mid-career workers update skills, provided courses include transparent assessments. While she recognises the convenience of self-paced study, she cautions that learners still need mentorship and peer interaction. Das also insists that credential platforms publish completion rates to reveal whether students finish modules. Ultimately she believes micro-credentials work best when embedded within a system that values both depth and flexibility.",

      "title": "Farming Beneath the City",
      "text": "Agronomist Rafael Costa manages a subterranean farm network built in disused subway tunnels beneath São Verdan. LED arrays tuned to specific wavelengths support leafy greens, mushrooms, and root vegetables. The tunnels maintain a constant 16°C, reducing energy needed for climate control. Hydroponic systems circulate nutrient solutions filtered by biochar columns that remove impurities. Costa's team tracks plant growth using sensors embedded in modular growing racks.\n\nTo integrate with the city's food system, the farm supplies produce to nearby schools and hospitals via cargo bikes, cutting delivery emissions. Researchers run taste panels comparing tunnel-grown crops with those from traditional farms to ensure flavour remains high. The operation captures condensation from tunnel ceilings, purifying it for reuse in irrigation. A collaboration with the transit authority schedules maintenance during overnight train closures. Data scientists analyse yield forecasts to adjust planting densities weekly. Community groups offer compost scraps that are processed into fertiliser for the hydroponic mix.",
