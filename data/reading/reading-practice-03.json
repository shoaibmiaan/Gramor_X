      "title": "The Four-Day Week Experiment",
      "text": "Companies piloting four-day weeks often report higher productivity, but the gains depend on redesigning workflows. Iceland’s large-scale trials saw staff reorganise meetings, automate routine reports, and adopt shared inboxes to reduce duplication. Critics feared service levels would drop, yet customer satisfaction held steady. Advocates say the approach works best when employees co-create schedules and managers focus on outcomes rather than hours spent at desks.",

      "text": "Remote-first companies hire talent regardless of location and provide digital stipends for home offices. Rather than leasing headquarters, they invest in annual retreats and local coworking passes. Analysts note that such firms can scale quickly, yet leadership must ensure equitable progression for staff who never meet in person. Emerging practices include transparent salary bands and virtual mentorship programmes that pair junior and senior employees across time zones.",

      "text": "Robotic tools are entering skilled trades such as welding and bricklaying. Rather than replacing craft workers, the machines handle repetitive tasks while humans focus on inspection and bespoke details. Apprenticeships now include coding basics so trainees can adjust machine settings on site. Industry bodies argue that this hybrid model can attract younger recruits if schools emphasise the blend of digital and manual expertise required.",
