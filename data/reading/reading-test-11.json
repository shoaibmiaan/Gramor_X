      "title": "Riverside's Harbourline Barrier",
      "text": "The Harbourline Barrier shields Riverside City from storm surges sweeping up the estuary. Built in the 1980s, it relied on manually lowered gates that took hours to prepare. Following several near misses, engineers retrofitted the structure with inflatable bladders that raise flood walls within minutes. They also dredged silt from the approach channel and installed fish-friendly turbines that generate electricity from tidal flows when the barrier is open.\n\nA new operations centre now receives live sea-level forecasts and deploys the barrier automatically when thresholds are exceeded. Maintenance crews conduct monthly dives to inspect the hinges and replace sacrificial anodes that prevent corrosion. Community volunteers practise evacuation drills alongside harbour police each spring. The retrofit included constructing a public promenade with educational displays about coastal resilience. Sensors embedded in the barrier transmit performance data to universities researching climate adaptation.",

      "text": "Professor Minh Nguyen advocates for open-source textbooks to reduce student costs and expand access to knowledge. She highlights universities where faculty collaborate to write and peer-review course materials published under permissive licences. Nguyen argues that students learn more effectively when they can annotate and adapt digital texts without restrictive digital rights management. She cautions, however, that open textbooks require sustainable funding for regular updates.\n\nNguyen supports grants that pay faculty for the time needed to revise materials each year. She rejects the notion that commercial publishers are the only source of quality content, pointing to studies showing comparable outcomes with open resources. At the same time, she insists that open textbooks should meet accessibility standards, including screen-reader compatibility. Nguyen urges institutions to invest in librarians who can help curate and distribute materials. She concludes that open educational resources flourish when communities share responsibility for maintaining them.",

Her team deploys arrays of microphones and speakers to test how voices carried in the ruins. They fire short bursts of sound to map echoes, then feed the data into 3D acoustic models. Petrov collaborates with stone conservators to understand how weathering changes a structure's resonance over centuries.\n\nThe project invites actors to perform historical scripts in reconstructed sound environments, comparing audience experiences with and without amplification. Portable sensors measure how modern seating installations affect sound distribution. Petrov's group works with local communities to collect oral histories about traditional performances once held in the sites. Results are shared through immersive exhibits where visitors wear headphones that simulate ancient acoustics. Insights from the research help engineers design contemporary open-air theatres with better natural amplification.",
