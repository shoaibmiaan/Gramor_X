      "title": "Inside the Aurora Film Archive",
      "text": "The Aurora Film Archive stores reels dating back to the 1920s, many of which exist in only a single copy. When an HVAC failure in 2016 caused humidity to spike, archivists realised their magnetic tape backups were degrading faster than expected. They built a new preservation vault with dual climate zones: one for nitrate film kept at minus five degrees Celsius, and another for acetate film at slightly warmer temperatures. Sensors feed data to a dashboard that alerts staff if humidity fluctuates by more than two percent.\n\nTo digitise fragile reels, the archive commissioned a custom scanner with sprocketless transport so brittle perforations would not tear. Volunteers catalogue metadata from production notes, cross-referencing scripts with surviving footage. The archive hosts screening nights where restored films are accompanied by historians discussing cultural context. Revenue from these events funds shipments of endangered reels from private collectors. A partnership with the national library ensures that digital masters are stored in geographically separate data centres for redundancy.",

      "text": "Science communicator Laleh Iqbal argues that festivals dedicated to science can transform public engagement when designed with community partners. She praises events that take place in neighbourhood plazas rather than conference halls, making it easier for families to attend. Iqbal insists that hands-on exhibits co-created with local schools resonate more than imported demonstrations. She criticises festivals that showcase celebrity scientists but fail to include grassroots organisations tackling environmental issues.\n\nIqbal supports paying citizen presenters stipends, saying compensation recognises lived expertise. She is wary of corporate sponsorships that demand control over messaging, preferring transparent agreements that disclose funder influence. While she values digital livestreams, she notes that reliable internet cannot be assumed, so organisers must provide offline activities too. Iqbal believes evaluation should measure long-term partnerships, not just attendee numbers.

      "text": "Urban ecologist Deon Clarke leads a project installing floating wetlands along the River Lumen to filter runoff before it reaches the estuary. The wetlands consist of modular rafts planted with native reeds whose roots dangle into the water, absorbing nutrients and heavy metals. Clarke's team anchors the rafts with adjustable cables that rise and fall with the tide, preventing damage during floods. Water quality sensors attached beneath each platform relay nitrate levels to a control room every hour.\n\nTo study wildlife benefits, students record fish and bird species that use the structures for shelter. Maintenance crews harvest excess plant growth and compost it for community gardens, ensuring contaminants are not returned to the river. The project partners with a wastewater utility that analyses whether the wetlands reduce treatment costs downstream. Artists collaborated to design interpretive signage explaining how the floating habitats function. After a year, the team observed a 35 percent drop in algal blooms along monitored stretches.",
