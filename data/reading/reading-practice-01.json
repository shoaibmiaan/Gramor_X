      "title": "Reimagining the Night-time City",
      "text": "Cities have traditionally prioritised daytime economic activity. Yet as retail patterns shift and flexible work becomes common, planners are reconsidering how streets function after dark. London and Melbourne now employ 'night mayors' who coordinate transport, policing, and culture to ensure evening economies remain vibrant without disturbing residents. Trials of 24-hour libraries and late-night childcare point to a future where services follow people’s schedules rather than the other way round. However, extending opening hours raises questions about fair pay and the environmental impact of running buildings overnight.",

      "title": "Microforests and Climate Adaptation",
      "text": "Microforests are compact plots densely planted with native species using a method pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. Despite covering less than a tennis court, they can host hundreds of species and dramatically improve soil quality. European towns now crowd-fund tiny forests to cool heat islands and absorb rainwater during intense storms. Critics question the cost of maintenance, but advocates argue that the approach reconnects communities with biodiversity and can be implemented on neglected roadside verges or school grounds.",

      "title": "Mobility Hubs in Suburban Areas",
      "text": "Suburban neighbourhoods often lack the transport options found in city centres. Mobility hubs aim to change that by combining bike hire, electric car clubs, parcel lockers, and community spaces in one location. Trial sites in the Netherlands show that when residents can access several transport modes within a short walk, private car usage drops by up to 15 percent. The success of such hubs depends on careful placement near schools or supermarkets, as well as reliable digital platforms that manage bookings and payments.",
