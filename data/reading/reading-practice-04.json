      "text": "Architects are experimenting with rooftop wetlands that filter rainwater and provide habitats for migrating birds. The systems layer lightweight soil, membrane liners, and shallow pools to mimic marshlands. Pilot projects in Singapore show the wetlands lowering building temperatures and capturing stormwater before it overwhelms drains. Maintenance crews must monitor mosquito populations, yet the biodiversity gains have attracted university researchers.",

      "text": "In New Zealand, immersion preschools known as kōhanga reo helped revive Māori language use among younger generations. Similar approaches are emerging in Canada and Norway, blending community elders’ stories with digital learning apps. Success relies on training fluent teachers and producing contemporary media—songs, podcasts, and comics—that make everyday usage natural. Funding remains patchy, but language advocates partner with broadcasters to reach national audiences.",
